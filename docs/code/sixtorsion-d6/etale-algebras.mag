	Magma code related to the paper "Asymptotics for 6-torsion and D_6" extensions, by:
		Peter Koymans, Robert J. Lemke Oliver, Efthymios Sofos, Frank Thorne.
	
	Magma code to compute data associated with the degree 12 etale algebras arising from Galois D6 fields, over Q2 and Q3.
	This is just a hub file to load the various subfiles, each of which handles a different place.
	We can then do whatever analysis we want on top of that.
