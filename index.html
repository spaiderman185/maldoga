<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am an associate professor in the Department of Mathematics at Tufts University.  My research focuses on arithmetic applications of analytic number theory, in particular to arithmetic statistics.  My research is supported by NSF grant DMS-2200760.

<p>I subscribe to the axioms laid out by Federico Ardila:
<ol>
	<li> Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

	<li> Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

	<li> Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

	<li> Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</ol>

<h2>My Last Name</h2>

Since it's caused confusion in the past, I should say that my last name is Lemke Oliver, not just Oliver or Lemke.  Think of it as a hyphenated name with a space instead of a hyphen.
